			<p><span class='begining'>Immigration advocates are</span> criticizing Immigration and Customs Enforcement for  monitoring undocumented immigrants with GPS tracking ankle monitors to make sure they don&#8217;st skip their deportation trial. They argue that it is an invasive method of surveillance and that it should be used sparingly. </p>
			<p><q>I just call them shackles,</q> Josselyn Atahualpa, an organizer with ICE Free NYC, an anti-deportation group, said of the ankle bracelets. <q> It&#8217;s ICE on your body.</q> </p>
			<p>Atahualpa and ICE Free NYC know this first hand because they have spoken to people in the alternative to detention program offered by the federally funded Intensive Superveillance Appearance Program.  Atahualpa wants to connect people in the program with community services, and  said that helping those dealing with the humiliation of GPS bracelets should be a high priority for all anti-ICE activists.</p>
		
			<p>ISAP is funded by ICE but is managed by a subsidiary of GEO Group, a publicly traded company that runs correction facilities and makes electronic monitors for prisoners and undocumented immigrants. </p>

			<p>ISAP&#8217;s highest priorities are <q>undocumented immigrants who can not be deported to their own countries who are at high risk of escaping supervision, and those who have commit crimes while under supervision,</q> according to a document put out by the Office of the Inspector General. An ISAP representative would not comment, and referred all inquiries to ICE.  ICE&#8217;s press representative did not return repeated calls either. </p>

			 <p> Despite the draconian sound of ankle bracelets, some legal advocates think there more humane than detaining undocumented immigrants in centers.  According to Ruthie Epstein, the only other alternatives are to have the immigrants released on their own recognizance - meaning the detainee is released with no conditions but a promise to show up for a court date, or to be put up on bond, a process that can be lengthy and expensive.</p>

			<p> The sole purpose of immigration detention is to make sure that the person shows up for their next court date, Epstein said, and ISAP is the only program ICE has to <q>mitigate flight risk,</q> or lower the chances that a person will skip the trial. </p>

			<p> But Epstein is concerned that ISAP is not used as an alternative to detainment, but to <q>widen the net,</q> so that more people are monitored. </p>

			<p> While detainment has decreased by in the past few years, Epstein said there is no way to conclude if this is because of ISAP or other factors.  ICE does not explain how they determine whether someone is detained rather than put in ISAP, Epstein and others  said, and that&#8217;s part of the problem. </p>

			<p><q>From the outside it doesn&#8217;t appear there is a consistent policy,</q> Epstein said.</p>

			<p>Mary Small, policy director at Detention Watch Network, also criticized ICE&#8217;s lack of transparency.
			<q>You would think within a functioning system, the number of people who are detained, and the number of people who are put in some kind of alternative to detention would in fact be linked,</q> Small said. </p>

			<p> Unlike Epstein, Small and her organization do not consider GPS monitoring an alternative to detention, but rather an <q>alternative form of detention,</q> since it restricts the movement of people in the program.</p>

			<p>Detention Watch Network is also opposed to the fact that a private company is running ISAP.  <q>Frankly the amount of money they&#8217;re making off of it is really concerning,</q> Small said. <q>And the ways they&#8217;re making what should ultimately be government decisions.</q></p>

			<p> But Epstein points out the program is cost-effective when compared to detention. According to the Office of the Inspector General, GPS monitoring costs ICE $4.41 a day through their private contract with GEO Group. For <q>full-service</q> monitoring, which includes appointed case workers, $8.37 a day is charged.  Immigration detention costs $161 a day, according to the A.C.L.U. <q>I would argue that it should be used in the fewest cases possible and only when absolutely necessary,</q> Epstein said.</P>
			
			<p>Epstein recommends community based options rather than surveillance. She points to the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service and the U.S. Council of Catholic Bishops as groups that give support to immigrants who are released on recognizance.
			<q>There&#8217;s not enough funding for that right now,</q> Epstein said. </p>
			
			<p>Atahualpa, who grew up in a Central American community in western Long Island, said the A.C.L.U.&#8217;s  hesitant support of ISAP is a compromise she doesn&#8217;t want to settle for. <q>I don&#8217;t want more detention centers and I also donâ€™t want these shackles. I want my people to be liberated,</q> Atahualpa said. 
			For now, Atahualpa will concentrate on the Central American communities on Long Island which she says make up most of those who check in with the ISAP office in Queens.
			<q>The Central American community there is so deep, and there aren&#8217;t a lot of resources,</q> Atahualpa said. <q>There&#8217;s a lot to push for out there, and nobody&#8217;s really doing that.</q></p>
